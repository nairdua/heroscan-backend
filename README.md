## Running

**Note**:  
1. This project mainly uses **Python 3.7.x**. Other versions can cause unexpected behavior.  
  * It's recommended to use [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage multiple Python versions in one machine.  
  * To keep your Python install clean, it's also recommended to use [`pyenv-virtualenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv). Create a virtualenv specifically for this project.
